Bought twice, would buy again",24/02/2024,"I bought this jacket first five years ago and ordered a large, which was my standard size at the time. What I got back then was a quality jacket but one that could be a bit uncomfortable to wear given that the arms were insulated with a weird material and it also ran quite small. Still, I rather liked it and thought it looked really nice, so I wore it until I put on some weight and outgrew it.Eventually ordered a new one in XXL, which is what I order in jackets now because I like them to be a little loose and baggy when I'm at work, my t-shirt size is XL. New version of the jacket is of even higher quality. The material it's made of still feels strong but is very very smooth almost like suede, and the arm insultation is vastly better. The XXL feels like it ran a little big this time, as it's quite loose on me now, moreso than other jackets I order in that size, but for me this is fine. I could easily wear a big sweater or hoodie with it in cold weather and still fit comfortably. If you're unsure, I would say you would likely be safe ordering this in your usual size even if you like things to hang a little looser. I bought the brown/'tobacco' color and it is an extremely attractive jacket I feel like I could wear a lot of places from my messy custodial job to mountain hiking to dinner at like a sit down sushi place. It's of a quality and appearance that I feel you could wear this on a date or a night out and you would look quite nice. The buttons look quite nice and are kind of a weathered brass look. Previous jacket had a problem with the wrist buttons coming undone constantly, seems to be fixed in this one. The flannel insulation is not thick and I would consider this more of a spring/fall jacket, but I could easily layer it if the temperatures dropped."

Functional & durable",28/04/2024,"Bought this for my farmer husband (Christmas 2023), who is an absolute terror on clothes! He gets dirty. Very dirty, working on farm equipment, & needs substantial layers of clothing during cold weather. This shirt has performed very well in all areas!  It launders very well, no shrinkage, fits him well (size XL). I would definitely give this a big thumbs up & hoping it's just as impressive when farming season & harvest 2024 is over & I have a really good feel for how well this stood up to the wear & tear. Not inexpensive, but so far worth every penny compared to store brands that look good but don't have the stamina to stand up to a full year of farming in northern Midwest USA."

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Cool-lookin Shacket",30/03/2024,"I purchased the Tobacco color, and thrilled with choice, in size Large. Obviously we all have different builds, but to give some perspective I am 5'11 & 3/4"", 180lbs., with a 42-43"" chest and 34"" waist. The shacket was slightly big in the stomach/waist area; however, after the initial wash, I stuck it in the dryer on high heat for 35-40 minutes (checking it periodically), which provided a slight shrink in the lower area...perfect for me! Also, regarding the velcro closure of the inside pocket, agree with others, its very strong. Prior to washing, I carefully repeatedly opened/closed the connection, on & off during the course of the day, in an attempt to loosen it up. After washing, and when dried, I placed a piece of strong-adhesive black electrical tape over the 'felt' side of the inside pocket closure, problem solved (temporarily) - probably will have to replace after each wash (not that big a deal). Although I plan to take it to my local tailor and have the pocket stitching reinforced and seek his recommendation for best solution to remedy any potential future issue! ✌🏻"

Neck is massive, great finish, body but good.",09/03/2024,"The fabric is really quite nice. Silky and decently think with a subtle sheen. The buttons are kind of weird and clumsy. The fit is quite boxy and loose. overall, it would be quite good if not for the massive neck opening. Ironic for a warm weather shirt, as you don’t want a big open neck area. I have a 16 1/2 neck and it’s swimming in this size large."

Nice jacket - could be better",23/03/2024,"I like the jacket a lot and will probably wear it until it falls apart.  The only downside is the pocket and internal sleeve fabric.  They show the fabric inside the jacket body as a flannel.  It is really thin, so don't expect to be warm, this is a spring/fall jacket.  It is comfortable and what I was looking for.  I thought that would be the case in the arms as well, but the arms have this really thin nylon fabric, that tbh is not very comfortable.  Be nice if they stuck with the cotton there.  Livable.The worst is though that they use that same nylon in the hand pockets, and it feels like if I drop my keys in there they will bust right through.  So, they cheap out on the parts they don't show you.Overall 4 stars, cause I was after a very lightweight jacket and I like it, but they cheaped out on those areas, which means no 5 star.  I am 5-10 and about 225, and got XL.  It is a good fit (if not a tad big, but I prefer baggier)"
